## Tuli and the windy Mountain

Note: I have been the sole programmer on all the projects I have worked on so far.

Tuli and the Windy Mountain was my first-semester project at the S4G School for Games. It was developed using the Godot engine with GScript. The game is a platformer featuring two types of enemies, a basic feel-good movement system, an umbrella mechanic, and speech boxes for dialogue.
