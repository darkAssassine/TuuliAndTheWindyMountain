# Tuuli and the Windy Mountain

**Tuuli and the Windy Mountain** was my first-semester project at S4G School for Games, developed using the **Godot Engine**. It was the first major project I worked on, and I had just started learning how to **program**. I was the **sole programmer** on a team of seven. The development time was **10 weeks**, and while the code structure is unpolished, I am showcasing it as a testament to my learning curve over the years.

## About the Game

This is a **2D platformer with 3D art**, where you play as a young girl equipped with a **magical umbrella** that allows her to **glide on the wind** and navigate through levels. The game features:

- **Responsive and satisfying movement mechanics**
- **Two enemy types**
- **Handcrafted levels**
- **A unique visual style combining 2D and 3D assets**
- **A dialogue system with speech boxes**

## What I Learned

Working on this project provided valuable insights into:

- Using the **Godot Engine** effectively
- Creating **responsive and engaging movement mechanics**
- Fundamental programming principles
- Collaborating within a multi-disciplinary team
